            <p>
                LIGRA’s Executive Director and Board Members monitor events occurring in the Local, State and Federal Governments. LIGRA retains lobbyists to handle both Albany and local legislation. Additionally, through LIGRA’s affiliation with NCPR (National Coalition of Petroleum Retailers), LIGRA members have full time representation in Washington, D.C.
                <br>
                <br>
                HERE IS A PARTIAL LISTING OF LIGRA’S LEGISLATIVE ACHIEVEMENTS:
            </p>

            <ul class="fa-ul">
                <li>LIGRA was instrumental in getting the Petroleum Marketing Practices Act passed. This Act protects retailers from unfair termination and non-renewals, unless an Oil Company can show just cause. LIGRA has now worked with our national association to successfully amend this act to give the state’s flexibility with their own laws.</li>

                <li>LIGRA was instrumental in getting the "Right of Survivorship" Law passed which allows a service station dealer to bequeath the business to their spouse or adults child. Under this law, a bequeathment form must be filed with the oil company before a dealer can exercise this right of survivorship.</li>

                <li>LIGRA was instrumental in getting a law passed permitting a dealer to sell his/her franchise. This allows a dealer to sell, transfer, or assign the franchise to another person, except under certain specified circumstances. Thus, a petroleum company cannot prohibit or prevent a dealer from selling, transferring, or assigning a franchise unless they have good cause and unless the sale, transfer or assignment is prohibited because of specified reasons, such as fraud.</li>

                <li>LIGRA has successfully repealed the nozzle fee in both Nassau & Suffolk County. We have been successful in working with the NYC Consumer Affairs Bureau in easing the burden of the regulatory process for our City members. LIGRA has been successful in minimizing the impact of the Cigarette Ban in both Nassau and Suffolk County. We have been successful in keeping our members out of the loop of the Suffolk County Crackhouse Law, which would have classified the sale of cigarettes and beer to a minor as the same offense as selling crack or cocaine. LIGRA has been successful in easing the burden of waste oil regulations by making consumers more responsible for the action.</li>

                <li>LIGRA held back the proposed Centralized Auto Emissions Testing program (when other associations stated, "it was a done deal") by bringing the ills of this program to the public’s attention. Today many of our auto repair shops are enjoying the benefits of the inspection program, without the expense of new equipment.</li>

                <li>These are just some of our Legislative achievements. There have been many more on all levels of government. LIGRA continues to strive to keep the voice of our membership in the forefront of all levels of government.</li>
